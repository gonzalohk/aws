# AWS Practioner Certification (Cheat Code)
## 1. Cloud Concepts
#### Understanding of Cloud Computing
- Definition: Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Benefits: Agility, elasticity, cost savings, scalability, and global reach.
#### Cloud Deployment Models
- Public Cloud: Resources are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider.
- Private Cloud: Resources are used exclusively by a single business or organization.
- Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public and private clouds bound together by technology for data and application sharing.
#### Cloud Service Models
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources  over the internet.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Provides software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
## 2. AWS Core Services
#### Compute Services
- Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- AWS Lambda: Run code without provisioning or managing servers.
- Amazon Elastic Beanstalk: Easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications.
#### Storage Services
- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Scalable storage in the cloud.
- Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store): Block storage for use with Amazon EC2.
- Amazon Glacier: Secure, durable, and low-cost storage service for data archiving and long-term backup.
#### Database Services
- Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed relational database service.
- Amazon DynamoDB: Fully managed NoSQL database service.

#### Networking Services
- Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud.
- Amazon CloudFront: Content delivery network (CDN) service.
- AWS Direct Connect: Dedicated network connection to AWS.
## 3. Security and Compliance
#### Shared Responsibility Model
- AWS Responsibility: Security "of" the cloud (hardware, software, networking, and facilities).
- Customer Responsibility: Security "in" the cloud (data, applications, identity and access management).
#### Security Services

- AWS Artifact: Central resource for compliance-related information.
## 4. Billing and Pricing
#### Pricing Models
- On-Demand: Pay for compute or database capacity by the hour or second.
- Reserved Instances: Lower pricing for committing to use for a specified term.
- Spot Instances: Bid for unused Amazon EC2 capacity.
### Cost Management
- AWS Free Tier: Free offers that allow you to use AWS services for free up to certain limits.
